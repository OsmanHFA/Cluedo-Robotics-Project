# Cluedo-Robotics-Project
Solving the Cluedo mystery problem by programming a robot to autonomously navigate an environment, and identify characters using Computer Vision. 

# Cluedo Mystery Problem 
1) Robot needs to identify and enter the green room (not the red room) using its onboard camera whilst avoiding collision with obstacles.
2) Robot needs to find the Cluedo poster in the green room and use Computer Vision to identify the Cluedo character

- Project was divided into two sections: Motion Planning and Computer Vision.
- Programming was written in ROS using python. 
- Implementation was done in Gazebo (simulation) and a real robot.
- Project worked well in simulation but experienced some issues when deployed on a real robot
